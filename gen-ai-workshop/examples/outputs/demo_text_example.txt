You are an AI tutor. Write a 3-line, encouraging tip for someone starting with generative AI:

1. Start small—explore simple models like distilgpt2 to learn basics quickly.
2. Practice prompts iteratively; add role, constraints, and format to guide outputs.
3. Validate outputs and respect data/privacy—don't use private data without consent.
