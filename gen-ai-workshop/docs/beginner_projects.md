# Beginner-Friendly Projects to Learn LLMs & RAG

Below are five beginner-friendly projects with short descriptions and links to tutorials to help participants practice LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

1. Building a Simple Q&A Chatbot using the GPT-4 API

   This project will guide you through creating a smart chatbot called “KnowItAll” using the GPT-4 API. The bot can answer questions, generate content, translate text, and even write code. The tutorial walks you through everything you need to know, from setting up a web interface with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to connecting the OpenAI API to build a conversational AI.
