# Beginner-Friendly Projects to Learn LLMs & RAG

Below are five beginner-friendly projects with short descriptions and links to tutorials to help participants practice LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

1. Building a Simple Q&A Chatbot using the GPT-4 API

   This project will guide you through creating a smart chatbot called “KnowItAll” using the GPT-4 API. The bot can answer questions, generate content, translate text, and even write code. The tutorial walks you through everything you need to know, from setting up a web interface with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to connecting the OpenAI API to build a conversational AI.

2. Summarizing a Video with LLMs

   Learn how to summarize YouTube videos using LLMs and ASR transcriptions. The tutorial shows how to grab video subtitles, fix punctuation with the Rpunct library, and send the cleaned text to OpenAI models to summarize or answer questions.
